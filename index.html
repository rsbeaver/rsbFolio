<div class="welcome">
  <p>I really enjoy making the Web a better place through good code and good design. I have been designing clean-looking websites for my own company use, and for friends, for over 15 years. This year I decided that it was time to take my knowledge to the next level. I took coding courses and received certification in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.<br> You see a sample of my latest projects here.</p>

    <p>I enjoyed making this site for you to explore, and I hope that you enjoyed looking at the projects and that you took a moment to play a round of Match Game (that was definitely a taxing project and I learned a great deal coding and testing it).<br><br>
    I am very familiar with deadlines, editing and reconfiguring having spent a great deal of my working life working at monthly magazines as a photographer, editor and executive editor.  I also worked seven years as National Account Executive and Press Relations Manager for a major European Auto Company.  My training in graphic arts was put to great use in all of those positions, and I use it to great effect when I design for the Web.<br><br>
    I am available to work on projects, either remotely or in office (San Antonio area).  I would welcome discussing your needs and how I could offer a solution to your coding needs.<br><br>
    I can be reached at the phone number and email address listed below.
    Thank you for taking the time to view and explore my work.<br><br>I value any feedback you care to give.</p>
